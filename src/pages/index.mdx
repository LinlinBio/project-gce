## Abstract

<section class="text-justify">
  Genetic code expansion (GCE) enables site-specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids but is limited by truncated protein accumulation from competition with host release factors. We developed a eukaryotic expression system that distinguishes and removes truncations using protein circuit design. Incorporating an N-terminal degron, a C-terminal localization tag, and a split TEV protease, the system selectively degraded truncated proteins while preserving full-length ones. This approach improved yields 1.4-fold and reduced truncations 4.6-fold, with tunability via small molecules and alternative localization signals. By enhancing protein fidelity and yield, our strategy strengthens the utility of GCE for precise protein engineering and live-cell imaging.

## Introduction

<section class="text-justify space-y-4">
  <p>
    Synthetic biology and protein engineering increasingly demand precise regulation of protein structure and function in living cells. Genetic code expansion (GCE) provides a powerful strategy by enabling site-specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids through engineered aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs, facilitating protein remodeling and fluorescent labeling.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, competition between GCE’s orthogonal translation components and host release factors frequently causes premature termination, leading to truncated proteins and reduced yields of full-length products. This inefficiency has limited the broader utility of GCE in protein engineering and live-cell applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    To address this challenge, we developed a eukaryotic expression system that selectively eliminates truncated proteins while preserving complete products. The design integrates an N-terminal degron (DHFR), a C-terminal localization tag, and a reconfigurable split TEV protease, enabling spatial separation and targeted degradation of truncations.
  </p>
  <p>
    This approach improved protein fidelity, increasing full-length yields and markedly reducing truncations, with further tunability through small-molecule drugs and alternative localization signals. By enhancing the efficiency of GCE, our system expands its applicability in synthetic biology, particularly for protein engineering and live-cell imaging.

## Methods
### Plasmid Construction
<section class="text-justify">
    To construct the degradation-based circuit, we designed protein sequences containing a degron at the N-terminus, a TEV protease cleavage site, and a localization signal at the C-terminus. For the nuclear localization system, two plasmids were generated:
    1. NLS-C: DHFR-TRAP-myc-tevs-V5-iRFP-EGFP-tevs-FLAG-NLS-Czipper-CTEV
    2. NLS-N: Nzipper-NLS-NTEV
  <p class="mt-4">
    The degron (mutated E. coli DHFR) promotes ubiquitin-mediated degradation in mammalian cells. The nuclear localization signal (NLS) directs the protein into the nucleus via the importin α pathway. The Czipper/Nzipper leucine zipper sequences mediate dimerization and thereby reconstitute the split TEV protease, enabling site-specific cleavage (Fig. 1).
  </p>
  <p class="mt-4">
    To obtain eukaryotic expression plasmids (pNLS-C and pNLS-N), individual fragments were amplified by PCR with homologous arms and assembled into linearized vectors using Gibson recombination. Constructs were verified by sequencing. Endotoxin-free plasmids were prepared for mammalian cell transfection.
  </p>
</section>

### Reporter System for GCE Readthrough Efficiency

<section class="text-justify">
  To monitor amber suppression efficiency, an iRFP-EGFP fusion reporter was constructed with a TAG mutation at EGFP position 39. In the absence of readthrough, truncated proteins contain only iRFP and emit far-red fluorescence. Successful readthrough produces full-length iRFP-EGFP, which emits both far-red and green fluorescence.
</section>

### Cell Culture and Transfection

<section class="text-justify">
HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with pNLS-C, pNLS-N, and the amber suppression system plasmid pcDNA3.1 U6FulltRNA-NES-PylRS(AF) (pPylRS-tRNA). Noncanonical amino acid (BOC) was supplemented as required. For time-controlled degradation experiments, 1 μM Trimethoprim (TMP) was added during medium replacement at 4–6 h post-transfection and removed at defined time intervals before cell collection.
</section>

### Imaging and Immunoblotting

<section class="text-justify">
Fluorescence imaging was performed at 24 h post-transfection using live HEK293T cells. Proteins were extracted by RIPA lysis and analyzed by immunoblotting to detect cleavage fragments and quantify the ratio of full-length to truncated proteins.
