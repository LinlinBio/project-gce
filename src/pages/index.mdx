## Abstract

<section class="text-justify">
  Genetic code expansion (GCE) enables site-specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids but is limited by truncated protein accumulation from competition with host release factors. We developed a eukaryotic expression system that distinguishes and removes truncations using protein circuit design. Incorporating an N-terminal degron, a C-terminal localization tag, and a split TEV protease, the system selectively degraded truncated proteins while preserving full-length ones. This approach improved yields 1.4-fold and reduced truncations 4.6-fold, with tunability via small molecules and alternative localization signals. By enhancing protein fidelity and yield, our strategy strengthens the utility of GCE for precise protein engineering and live-cell imaging.

## Introduction

<section class="text-justify">
  Synthetic biology and protein engineering increasingly demand precise regulation of protein structure and function in living cells. Genetic code expansion (GCE) provides a powerful strategy by enabling site-specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids through engineered aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs, facilitating protein remodeling and fluorescent labeling.

  However, competition between GCE’s orthogonal translation components and host release factors frequently causes premature termination, leading to truncated proteins and reduced yields of full-length products. This inefficiency has limited the broader utility of GCE in protein engineering and live-cell applications.

  To address this challenge, we developed a eukaryotic expression system that selectively eliminates truncated proteins while preserving complete products. The design integrates an N-terminal degron (DHFR), a C-terminal localization tag, and a reconfigurable split TEV protease, enabling spatial separation and targeted degradation of truncations.

  This approach improved protein fidelity, increasing full-length yields and markedly reducing truncations, with further tunability through small-molecule drugs and alternative localization signals. By enhancing the efficiency of GCE, our system expands its applicability in synthetic biology, particularly for protein engineering and live-cell imaging.
